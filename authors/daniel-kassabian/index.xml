      <description>Hi,
Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a very simple tool that may be useful for other DCS World developers.
It is a simple python script that automates the creation of your aircrafts joystick input lua file, so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to make it twice. It does this by copying your keyboard lua setup file.
To use the script, simply place it in your DCS modules input/keyboard folder and run it.

      <title>OpenVSP Workshop Presentation</title>

      <description>Greetings!
Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you a joint presentation that I did with Dr Vivek Ahuja from Research in Flight for the 2022 OpenVSP Workshop, held in the National Institute of Aerospace (Virginia).
The presentation focuses on the latest developments in Flightstream, including the CCS format and how that is significantly improving the experience of using Flightstream. As a part of this work and to facilitate a greater connection between Flightstream &amp;amp; OpenVSP, I have created a simple software utility that converts an OpenVSP model into a useable Flightstream CCS file.</description>

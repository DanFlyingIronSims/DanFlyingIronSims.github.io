      <description>Greetings!
Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you a joint presentation that I did with Dr Vivek Ahuja from Research in Flight for the 2022 OpenVSP Workshop, held in the National Institute of Aerospace (Virginia).
The presentation focuses on the latest developments in Flightstream, including the CCS format and how that is significantly improving the experience of using Flightstream. As a part of this work and to facilitate a greater connection between Flightstream &amp;amp; OpenVSP, I have created a simple software utility that converts an OpenVSP model into a useable Flightstream CCS file.</description>
